# Design Problems

This folder contains problems that focus on **designing data structures or systems**
with specific constraints such as time complexity, memory usage, and behavior.

These questions usually require combining multiple data structures and thinking
about how operations work internally — not just writing a single algorithm.

---

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Designing reusable data structures  
- Maintaining O(1) or near-O(1) operations  
- Handling edge cases and constraints  
- Writing clean, modular, and intuitive code  
- Explaining the reasoning behind the design

---

## 🧩 Common patterns in this folder

- HashMap + Doubly Linked List (ex: **LRU Cache**)  
- Queue/Stack design  
- Set/Map based designs  
- Custom iterators  
- Caching strategies  
- Rate limiters / hit counters  
- Object-oriented design thinking

## 📝 Format for each problem

Every problem in this folder includes:

1. **Problem summary**
2. **Intuition**
3. **Design explanation (how the data structure works)**
4. **Complexity analysis**
5. **Code implementation**

## 📌 Examples you might see here

- LRU Cache  
- LFU Cache  
- Min Stack  
- Recent Counter  
- Design HashMap / HashSet  
- Design Twitter  
- Design Circular Queue

Design problems are great preparation for **system design and real-world interviews**, so I revisit and improve solutions regularly.

Happy building! 🚀

# Tree Problems

This folder contains problems based on **binary trees, BSTs, and tree traversal
techniques**. Trees are one of the most fundamental data structures used in
searching, organizing data, and representing hierarchical relationships.

---

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Understanding tree structure and properties  
- Recursive vs iterative traversal  
- Working with Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- Handling parent-child relationships  
- Depth and height calculations  
- Lowest Common Ancestor problems  
- Converting recursive logic into iterative logic  

---

## 🧩 Common patterns in this folder

- Inorder / Preorder / Postorder traversal  
- Level-order traversal (BFS using queue)  
- DFS recursion  
- Path-based problems  
- Tree diameter  
- Balanced tree checks  
- BST insert / delete / search  
- Constructing trees from traversals

## 📝 Format for each problem

Every tree problem here includes:

1. **Problem summary**
2. **Intuition**
3. **Approach (DFS / BFS / recursion, etc.)**
4. **Complexity analysis**
5. **Code implementation**

Trees appear everywhere — databases, compilers, operating systems,
file systems, web browsers, and more. Mastering tree problems builds
strong recursion and structural thinking skills.

Keep practicing — trees become intuitive over time! 🌳🚀

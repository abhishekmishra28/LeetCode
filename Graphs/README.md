# Graph Problems

This folder contains problems based on **graphs** — one of the most important
topics in algorithms and interviews. Graph questions help build intuition
around connectivity, traversal, shortest paths, and cycle detection.

---

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Representing graphs (Adjacency List / Matrix)
- Traversal techniques (BFS / DFS)
- Detecting cycles
- Shortest path algorithms
- Working with directed vs. undirected graphs
- Handling weighted graphs
- Understanding connected components

---

## 🧩 Common patterns in this folder

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Topological Sorting
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford (conceptually)
- Flood fill / graph traversal on grids
- Cycle detection (directed + undirected)

## 📝 Format for each problem

Every problem here follows:

1. **Problem summary**
2. **Intuition**
3. **Approach (BFS / DFS / DSU / etc.)**
4. **Complexity analysis**
5. **Code implementation**

## 📌 Examples you may see here

- Number of Islands  
- Clone Graph  
- Detect Cycle in Graph  
- Course Schedule (Topological Sort)  
- Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph (BFS)  
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal / Prim)  
- Dijkstra for weighted shortest paths

Graph problems train deep problem-solving intuition — solving them regularly
makes you stronger across **many** DSA topics.

Happy exploring! 🚀

# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems — each with
clear intuition, approach, and time/space complexity.  
I maintain this as a learning journal and as a reference for interview preparation.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong problem-solving habits  
- Document thought process (not just final code)  
- Recognize patterns across problems  
- Create a structured revision resource  
- Keep solutions clean, readable, and optimized

LeetCode/
 ├── Arrays/
 ├── Strings/
 ├── LinkedList/

Each folder contains:

- `codeName.cpp` -> Actual Code wih Explaination
- `README.md` → About the Topic

## 🧠 Solution Format

For every problem, I try to document:

1. **Problem summary (in my own words)**
2. **Intuition — what idea unlocked the solution**
3. **Step-by-step approach**
4. **Complexity analysis**
5. **Final code**

This helps build patterns instead of memorizing answers.

## 💡 Notes

Some problems may include:

- Multiple approaches
- Comments explaining tricky edge cases
- Related problem references

I revisit older solutions to refactor and improve whenever I learn better techniques.

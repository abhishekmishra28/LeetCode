# Arrays Problems

This folder contains problems that focus on working with **arrays** —
one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.

Array questions help build strong foundations in iteration, indexing,
boundary handling, and optimizing time/space complexity.

---

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Traversing arrays efficiently  
- Handling carry, rotation, merging, and searching  
- Understanding off-by-one and boundary edge cases  
- Using arrays with hashing and sorting  
- Writing clean, readable, and optimized code  

---

## 🧩 Common patterns in this folder

- Prefix / suffix techniques  
- Two-pointer approach  
- Sliding window  
- Sorting + greedy  
- Hash-based lookups  
- In-place modification  
- Carry propagation problems (like **Plus One**)

## 📝 Format for each problem

Each solution typically contains:

1. **Problem summary**
2. **Intuition / thought process**
3. **Approach explanation**
4. **Time & space complexity**
5. **C++ implementation**

## 📌 Examples included (or coming soon)

- Plus One  
- Two Sum  
- Merge Sorted Arrays  
- Rotate Array  
- Remove Duplicates  
- Move Zeroes  
- Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock  

---

Arrays appear everywhere — from interview questions to real-world applications —  
so building strong array intuition will make advanced topics easier later.

Happy coding! 🚀

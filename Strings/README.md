# String Problems

This folder contains problems focused on **string manipulation and processing**.
String questions help develop logic around indexing, pattern matching, and
efficient handling of characters and substrings.

---

## 🎯 What you’ll practice here

- Traversing and modifying strings  
- Working with character arrays  
- Handling substrings and subsequences  
- Counting frequencies and patterns  
- Reversing, rotating, and transforming strings  
- Using hashing for string comparisons  
- Avoiding unnecessary extra space and copies

## 🧩 Common patterns in this folder

- Two-pointer techniques  
- Sliding window  
- Frequency maps / character counts  
- Palindrome checks  
- String compression  
- Pattern searching  
- Anagram checking  
- Substring / subsequence problems  
- Hashing and rolling hash (advanced)
